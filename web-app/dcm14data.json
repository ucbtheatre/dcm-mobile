What happens at a show? Drawing on the various energies that careen about their environment, the crew of artists and actors utilize and exploit audience perceptions and reactions to cultivate a spirit of intense mutual engagement. Members of the audience are periodically called upon to shout out their ideas, which in turn fuel the brief scenes and bouts of lyricism that Krane and his cohorts use to connect the dots of an overall shared experience.  At times it\u2019s slapstickingly foolish, at times poignantly honest and provocative. Grasshoppah\u2019s comic personalities are dynamic, yet complimentary, giving way to fluid scenes of satire and social commentary. Krane, known for having a hand in an amalgam of underground and pop-music scenes (folk singing, off the cuff jazz-rap-freestyling with underground legend, Eyedea, in their free-jazz-rap improv band entitled, \u201cFaceCandy\"), demands that his audience challenge him with the headiest topics they can conjure, and shows his witful keanness by asking for ideas and issues to be randomly shouted at him, which he eagerly pours into a stew of quick witted rap. Most impressive in this arrangement is the seemingly innate skill of timing shared by all involved, a skill one rarely encounters outside the realm of good and proper jazz. Grasshoppah and Kristoff Krane keep their audiences engaged and on their toes. The experience is not one of passive witness, but active participant, leaving all involved with a sense of having communed for an in-the-stream of consciousness-moment of sheer creation that can never be relived again.  \r\n",
